# About GenPDF:
I created this app for a wider audience, giving it a functional gui design for desktop use.
You can generate blank PDF files with custom header, footer and even with lines. You can adjust how many pages you want to generate.

For companies who would run it internally or people who would use only the srcipt, please refer to this repo:
